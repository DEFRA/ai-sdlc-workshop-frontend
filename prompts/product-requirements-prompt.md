# CONTEXT

We're creating a frontend multi-step form for a fictional GOV.UK service for registering surplus forms. It is to be used for a demo

# ANALYSIS PHASE

Analyse the attached artifacts in detail:

1. An image containing GOV.UK screen designs in a multi-step user flow for registering surplus forms
2. An interface design spec, containing the GOV.UK screens designs and user journey
3. A technical design spec, containing the data model and API's

# IMPLIMENTATION PHASE

Create a detailed product requirements document that breaks down the functionality by feature and user stories.  There should be one feature per page. The end result should be a list of features, with user stories detailed for the given feature. The stories should be discrete and detailed.  There may be multiple stories per feature.   Please number the features and the stories so they can be easily referred to later.

Each feature should give any overarching context in the feature description.

Each story within the feature should be in the following format:

* Story title
* Testable functional acceptance criteria in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) format - Given, When, Then
* Reference relevant sections in the interface design spec. Do not repeat interface design but tell it to implement as per the interface design
* Reference relevant sections in the technical design spec. Do not repeat technical design


Do NOT include any summary, timelines, or non-functional requirements, unless they are relevant to the specific feature implementations.
Do NOT add any functionality that isn't in the above requirements, only add the functionality already defined.
Do NOT put the stories in a markdown table, rather write the stories out as prose.

Include a short 'Context' part at the top of the document that details the purpose and background information that is relevant to the project overall.

# VERIFICATION AND COMPLETION PHASE:
Validate your work to check that all the features defined in the documents above meet all the necessary requirements and there is no ambiguity or overlap before writing the final output.
