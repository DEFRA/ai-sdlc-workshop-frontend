For this folder in the prototype please analyse and create a markdown file containing:

- The page flow, including which user input data is being carried over and where it is displayed

Example output for page flow:

The Register Surplus Forms service follows this user journey:

1. ****Start page**** (`index.html`) → 
2. ****Form selection**** (`form-details.html`) → 
3. ****Upload form**** (`form-upload.html`) → 
4. ****Pen color**** (`digital-product.html`) → 
5. ****Guidance question**** (`form-guidance.html` or `form-guidance-validation.html` with validation) → 
6. ****Check answers**** (`check-answers.html`) → 
7. ****Confirmation**** (`confirmation.html`)

A page specification for each page, including:
* page type
* the typography
* e.g. H1, paragraph, bullet list, labels, hint text
* all text for each element exactly as displayed
* the components and patterns used on the page as per the GDS design system
* where appropriate, include which variant of the component is used (e.g. for radios: inline, with text divider, conditional reveal, etc)
* exclude the header and footer
* the user input data carried over from each page and any input data is displayed

Example output:
- **Page type:** Start page
