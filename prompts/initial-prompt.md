I have provided you with:
1. An interface design document, containing the GOV.UK screens designs and user journey
2. A technical design document, containing the data model and API's
3. A product requirements document, containing features and user stories

Please analyze these documents and implement all features and stories as follows:

1. First, outline your understanding of:
   - The specific requirements
   - How this feature integrates with existing functionality
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites

2. Perform a codebase analysis focusing on:
   - Existing patterns and conventions to follow
   - Integration points for the new feature
   - Reusable components or utilities

3. Provide an implementation plan including:
   - Component/file structure
   - Required changes to existing code
   - New components/modules to be created

4. For the implementation:
   - Follow the frontend cursor rules
   - Follow existing code conventions and patterns
   - Implement the UI design and content as per the interface design
   - Remove the existing indexRouter to ensure the new functionality takes precedence

5. Verification checklist:
   - The `/` route is updated to render the new start page
   - List each requirement from the features and user stories in the PRD
   - List each screen and verify that the design and content is implemented EXACTLY as per the interface design

Constraints:
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase
- Follow the frontend cursor rules
- Do not add any unit tests at this time
