I'll provide you with:
1. An image containing GOV.UK screen designs in a multi-step user flow for registering surplus forms
2. A Design Spec for the GOV.UK screens designs
3. API documentation for the Register Surplus Forms backend service
4. A PRD containing features and stores that correlate to the screen designs, user flow diagram and the API Documentation

Please analyze these and implement as follows:

1. First, outline your understanding of:
   - The specific requirements
   - How this feature integrates with existing functionality
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites

2. Perform a codebase analysis focusing on:
   - Existing patterns and conventions to follow
   - Integration points for the new feature
   - Reusable components or utilities

3. Provide an implementation plan including:
   - Component/file structure
   - Required changes to existing code
   - New components/modules to be created

4. For the implementation:
   - Follow existing code conventions and patterns
   - Implement the UI design and content as per the screen designs and design spec

5. Verification checklist:
   - List each requirement from the user stories in the PRD
   - List each screen design and verify that the design and content is EXACTLY as per the screen design and design spec

Constraints:
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase
- Follow GOV.UK Frontend cursor rules
- The UI design and content must be EXACTLY as per the screen design and design spec
- Do not add any unit tests at this time
