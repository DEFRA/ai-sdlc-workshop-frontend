# Project Structure Standards

This project follows a standard Express.js application structure with GOV.UK Frontend integration:

- `src/` - Main source code directory
  - `app.js` - Main application entry point
  - `logger.js` - Logging configuration
  - `views/` - Nunjucks templates
  - `routes/` - Express route handlers
  - `public/` - Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)

## File Organization Rules

1. All new routes should be added to the `src/routes/` directory
2. All new views should be added to the `src/views/` directory
3. All static assets should be placed in the `src/public/` directory
4. Keep the main `app.js` file focused on application setup and configuration
5. Use the logger from `logger.js` for all logging needs

## Naming Conventions

- Route files: `[feature].js`
- View files: `[feature].njk`
- Static assets: Use kebab-case for filenames
- JavaScript files: Use camelCase for filenames
